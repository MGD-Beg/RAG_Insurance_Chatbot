# RAG_Insurance_Chatbot
   This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot** using the **Gemma 3B model from Ollama**, powered by a vector store built from custom PDF documents. The chatbot can answer user questions using only the contents of the provided documents and responds with **"I don't know"** if the information is not found.
